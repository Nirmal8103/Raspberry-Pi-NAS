# Raspberry-Pi-NAS
This research aims to develop and implement a local NAS (Network Attached Storage) for individuals looking for solutions to store their data without having to pay other external vendors like Google Cloud, Apple Cloud, or OneDrive. This research addresses data storage, performance, power consumption, and data access reliability. The research implementation is done in 3 phases.
Phase-1: It covers hardware requirements, software installation, SSH connection, Server Configuration, and Disk Mount.
Phase-2: It covers NextCloud installation and configuration of Auto-upload features in personal devices.
Phase-3: It covers vulnerability testing, analysis, and security recommendations. It also covers the implementation of secure communications using https protocols.
